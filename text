If a photon of definite polarization encounters an excited atom,
there is typically some nonvanishing probability that the atom will emit a second photon by 
stimulated emission. Such a photon is guaranteed to have the same polarization as the original 
photon. But is it possible by this or any other process to amplify a quantum state, that is, to 
produce several copies of a quantum system (the polarized photon in the present case) each having 
the same state as the original? If it were, the amplifying process could be used to ascertain the 
exact state of a quantum system: in the case of a photon, one could determine its 
polarization by first producing a beam of identically polarized copies and
then measuring the Stokes parameters.

We show here that the linearity of quantum mechanics 
forbids such replication and that this conclusion holds for all quantum systems.
.pp
Note that if photons could be cloned, a plausible argument
could be made for the possibility of faster-than-light communication.

It is well known that for certain non-separably correlated Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen 
pairs of photons, once an observer has made a polarization measurement 
(say, vertical versus horizontal) on one member of the pair, 
the other one, which may be far away, can be for all purposes of prediction 
regarded as having the same polarization.

If this second photon could be replicated and its precise polarization measured 
as above, it would be possible to ascertain whether, for example, the first 
photon had been subjected to a measurement of linear or circular polarization. 
In this way the first observer would be able to transmit information faster than 
light by encoding his message into his choice of measurement. 
The actual impossibility of cloning photons, shown below, thus prohibits super 
luminal communication by this scheme. That such a scheme must fail for some reason despite the 
well-established existence of long-range quantum correlations6 8 , is a general consequence
of quantum mechanics.

A perfect amplifying device would have the following effect
on an incoming photon with polarization state $ | s > $:
.EQ (1)
|A sub 0 > | s > -> | A sub s > | ss > 
.EN

.pp
Here $ | A sub 0 > $ is the `ready' state of the apparatus, 
and $ | A sub s > $ is its final state, which may or may 
not depend on the polarization of the original photon. The symbol $| ss > $ refers to the state of 
the radiation field in which there are two photons each having
the polarization $| s > $. Let us suppose that such an amplification can in fact be accomplished for 
the vertical polarization $ | V > $ and for the horizontal polarization $ | H > $. That is,
.EQ (2)
| A sub 0 > | V > -> | A sub v > | V V >
.EN
and
.EQ (3)
| A sub 0 > | H > -> | A sub h > | H H >
.EN
.pp
According to quantum mechanics this transformation should
be representable by a linear (in fact unitary) operator. It therefore follows that if the 
incoming photon has the polarization given by the linear combination 
$ alpha~| V > + beta~| H > $ - for example, it 
could be linearly polarized in a direction 45\(de from the vertical, so that $ alpha = beta = 2 sup {-1/2} $ the 
result of its interaction with the apparatus will be the superposition of equations (2) and (3):
.EQ (4)
| A sub 0 > ( alpha~ | V > + beta ~| H > ) -> 
alpha~ | A sub v > | VV > + beta ~ | A sub h > | HH > 
.EN
.pp
If the apparatus states $ | A sub v > $ and $ | A sub h > $ are not identical, 
then the two photons emerging from the apparatus are in a mixed state of polarization. 
If these apparatus states are identical, then the two photons are in the pure state
.EQ (5)
alpha ~| VV > + beta ~| HH >
.EN
.pp
In neither of these cases is the final state the same as the state
with two photons both having the polarization $ alpha ~| V > + beta ~| H > $. 
That state, the one which would be required if the apparatus were to be a perfect 
amplifier, can be written as
.EQ
2 sup {-1/2} ( alpha a sub v dagger + beta a sub h dagger ) sup 2 | 0 > =
alpha sup 2 | VV > + 2 sup {1/2} alpha beta | VH > + beta sup 2 | HH >
.EN
which is a pure state different from the one obtained above by superposition [equation (5)).
Thus no apparatus exists which will amplify an arbitrary polarization. 
The above argument does not rule out the possibility of a device which can amplify 
two special polarizations, such as vertical and horizontal. 
Indeed, any measuring device which distinguishes between these two polarizations, 
a Nicol prism for example, could be used to trigger such an amplification.
.pp
The same argument can be applied to any other kind of quantum system. As in the case of photons, 
linearity does not forbid the amplification of any given state by a device designed especially for 
that state, but it does rule out the existence of a device capable of amplifying an arbitrary 
state.
.pp
Milonni (unpublished work) has shown that the process of stimulated emission does not lead to 
quantum amplification, because if there is stimulated emission there must also be - with equal 
probability in the case of one incoming photon - spontaneous emission, and the polarization of a 
spontaneously emit ted photon is entirely independent of the polarization of the original.
.pp
It is conceivable that a more sophisticated amplifying apparatus could get around Milonni's 
argument. We have there fore presented the above simple argument, based on the linearity of 
quantum mechanics, to show that no apparatus, however complicated, can amplify an arbitrary 
polarization.
.pp
We stress that the question of replicating individual photons
is of practical interest. It is obviously closely related to the
quantum limits on the noise in amplifiers.

Moreover, an experiment devised to establish the 
extent to which polarization of single photons can be replicated through the process of stimulated 
emission is under way (A. Gozzini, personal communication; and see ref. 12). The quantum 
mechanical prediction is quite definite; for each perfect clone there is also one randomly 
polarized, spontaneously emitted, photon.
