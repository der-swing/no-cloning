If a photon of definite polarization encounters an excited atom,
there is typically some nonvanishing probability that the atom will emit a second photon by 
stimulated emission. Such a photon is guaranteed to have the same polarization as the original 
photon. But is it possible by thls or any other process to amplify a quantum state, that is, to 
produce several copies of a quantum system (the polarized photon in the present case) each having 
the same state as the original? If it were, the amplifying process could be used to ascertain the 
exact state of a quantum system:  in the case of a  photon,  one  could  determine  lts  
polarization by first producing  a beam  of  identically  polarized  copies  and
then measuring the Stokes parameters1  We show here that the llnearity  of  quantum  mechanics  
forbids  such  replication  and that  this conclusion holds for all quantum  systems.
.pp
Note that  if photons could  be cloned,  a  plausible  argument
could be made for the possibility of faster-than-light communication2  . It is well  known  that 
for certain  non-separably  correlated Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs of photons, once an observer 
has made a polarization measurement (say, vertical versus horizontal) on one member of the pair, 
the other one, which may be far away, can be for all purposes of prediction regarded as having the 
same polarization3  If this second photon could be replicated and its precise polarization 
measured as above, it would be possible to ascertain whether, for example, the first photon had 
been subjected to a measurement of linear or circular polarization. In this way the first observer 
would be able to transmit information faster than light by encoding his message into bis choice of 
measurement. The actual impossibil ity of cloning photons, shown below, thus prohibits super 
luminal communication by this scheme. That such a scheme must fail for some reason despite the 
well-established existence of long-range quantum correlations6 8 , is a general consequence
of quantum mechanics 9

A perfect amplifying device would  have the following  effect
on an incoming photon  with polarization  state $ | s > $:
.EQ (1)
|A sub 0 > | s > -> | s > +- | A sub s > | ss > 
.EN

.pp
Here $ | A sub 0 > $ is the `ready' state of the  apparatus,  
and $ | A sub s > $ is its final state, which may or may  
not depend on the polarization of the original photon. The symbol $| ss > $ refers to the state  of 
the radiation  field in which there are two photons each having
the polarization $| s > $. Let us suppose that such an amplification can  in fact  be accomplished  for  
the vertical  polarization $ | V > $ and for the horizontal polarization $ | H > $. That is,
.EQ (2)
| A sub 0 > | V > -> | A sub v > | V V >
.EN
and
.EQ (3)
| A sub 0 > | H > -> | A sub h > | H H >
.EN

According  to  quantum  mechanics  this  transformation  should
be representable by a linear (in fact unitary) operator. It therefore follows that if the 
incoming photon has the polarization given by the linear combination 
$ alpha~| V > + beta~| H > $ - for example, it 
could be linearly polarized in a direction 45\(de from the vertical, so that $ alpha = beta = 2 sup {-1/2} $ the 
result of its interaction with the apparatus will be the superposition  of equations (2)  and  (3):

If  the apparatus states IAvc,,) and IAh 0   , )    are not identical, then the two photons 
emerging from the apparatus are in a mixed state of polarization. If these apparatus  states  are  
identical,  then  the two photons are in  the pure  state
*** (5)
.pp
In neither of these cases is the final state the same as the state
with two photons both having the polarization  alt  )+l++). That state, the one which would be 
required  if the apparatus were tobe a perfect  amplifier, can be written as

which is a pure state different from the one obtained above by superposition  [equation (5)).
Thus no apparatus exists which will amplify  an arbitrary
polarization. The above argument does not rule out the possibility of a device which can amplify 
two special polarizations, such as vertical and horizontal. Indeed, any measuring device which 
distinguishes between these  two polarizations, a Nicol prism for example, could  be used to 
trigger such an amplification.
The same argument can be applied to any other kind of quantum system. As in the case of photons, 
linearity does not forbid the amplification of any given state by a device designed especially for 
that state, but it does rule out the existence of a device capable of  amplifying an arbitrary  
state.

Milonni (unpublished work) has shown that the process of stimulated emission does not lead to 
quantum amplification, because if there isstimulated emission there must also be-with equal 
probability in the case of one incoming photon-spon taneous emission, and the polarization of a 
spontaneously emit ted photon is entirely independent of the polarization of the original.
.pp
It is conceivable that a more sophisticated amplifying apparatus could get around Milonni's 
argument. We have there fore presented the above simple argument, based on the iinearity of 
quantum mechanics, to show that no apparatus, however complicated, can amplify an arbitrary 
polarization.
.pp
We stress that  the question  of  replicating  individual photons
is  of  practical  interest.  It is obviously  closely  related  to the
quantum limits on the noise in amplifiers (10 11). Moreover, an experiment devised to establish the 
extent to which polarization of single photons can be replicated through the process of stimulated 
emission is under way (A. Gozzini, personal communication; and see ref. 12). The quantum 
mechanical prediction is quite definite; for each perfect clone there is also one randomly  
polarized,  spontaneously  emitted, photon.
